## Update
added gradients to the header and footer

switched dots from svgs to empty divs

Figured out alternating Rows (Sort of) I had it set up, but when I added in the toggle function for the select box of phone and email, the nth-child selector did not target the email list.. I do not know why this is :/ So it is on the name and phone lists, but not on this email list yet!
## Notes from Matthew
This is as far as I got with a three hour limit. HTML and CSS set up were pretty straight forward. The only thing I did not know how to exectute was the slight color alteration in the rows of the grid for the names and emails (from the lighter grey to the darker grey.) 

Being completley honest, Javascript wise I did not know much. I did not use any outside resources when doing this, as it was an assesment of myself. I attemted to set up an if statement in the js to switch from email to display when the select button was switched, but this is something I have not learned yet so I got stuck! I have knowelege of using an event listener on a simple button to toggle from one display to another(grid/list view, dark/light mode etc.), but when it comes to a select box, I did not know how to switch based off of the button selection. If I were to spend some more time I could probably do some research and figure it out. Same goes for the overlay on when you click on a name to get the persons information to pop up.

If you could point me in the right directeion to learn more about these functions, or any other tools I might need to look into before mid-April, that would be great. I want to get the most out of this internship and experience, and I am willing to spend some extra time before hand learing and practicing.

I will be in Web 3 this spring quarter as well, and I feel that learning from both the intership and this class will really help me improve over the next few months.

## Skills Assessment

Fork the repo and create the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the widget as described in the [Contact List image](https://github.com/14four/skills-assessment/blob/master/contactListUpdated.jpg).  It should take you about 3 hours, but you should try and complete it without taking an entire day. You will be asked to explain any places where your solution does not match the spec.  Please target modern browsers, do not use images, and bonus points for graceful degradation and legacy support solutions.  We wish to assess your CSS skills, so don't use a CSS Framework like Bootstrap or Foundation, they have their place, but this is not it. JQuery is not needed to complete this exercise, we would like to assess your Javascript skills without the use of this library. 

Please code the page according to industry best practices and organize the assets as you would if delivering it to a client to integrate (not necessarily to deploy).

Bonuses: Keep it simple, don't overuse JavaScript.  Prioritize modern browsers - graceful degredation is our friend.
